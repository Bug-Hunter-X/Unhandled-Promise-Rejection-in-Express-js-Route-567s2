# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where asynchronous operations within routes are not properly handled, leading to silent failures.  The bug occurs because the asynchronous operation's `.catch` block only logs the error and doesn't send a response to the client, leaving the user unaware of the failure.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that performs an asynchronous operation using `someAsyncOperation()`. If this operation fails, the error is logged to the console, but no error response is sent back to the client. This results in a poor user experience and makes debugging difficult.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle asynchronous operations in Express.js routes. By using `async/await` or proper `.catch` handling within the route handler, we ensure that appropriate error responses are sent to the client in case of failure, improving the reliability and user experience of the application.
